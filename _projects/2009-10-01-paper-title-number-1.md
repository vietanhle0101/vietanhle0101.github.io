permalink: /projects/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this project, we develop efficient adaptive sampling strategies for resource-constrained Mobile Robotic Sensor Network for monitoring a spatial phenomenon based on Gaussian Process. The adaptive sampling problem can be formulated as minimizing the negative log determinant of a predicted covariance matrix, which is a non-convex and highly complex function. Moreover, the constraints on robot mobility such as nonholonomic dynamics and inter-robot collision avoidance are taken into consideration. Some optimization techniques like Proximal ADMM and Successive Convexification Programming can be applied to efficiently solve this problem in continuous domain.'
