# Gaussian Process based  Model Predictive Control
<!-- ![](../images/ccta.png) -->

This project aims to enhance the performance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for single dynamical systems or multi-agent systems by using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to learn system dynamics.

# Adaptive Sampling for Mobile Robotic Sensor Networks
<!-- ![](../images/mrsn.png) -->

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Linh Nguyen from Australia Federation University. In this project, we develop efficient adaptive sampling strategies for a resource-constrained Mobile Robotic Sensor Network for monitoring a spatial phenomenon based on Gaussian Process.

# Modeling and Control of Overhead Crane/Ship-mounted Crane

This research and experiment were conducted when I was an undergraduate research intern at School of Mechanical Engineering, Vietnam Maritime University. My duty includes designing anti-swing control algorithms for uncertain overhead crane/ship-mounted crane using sliding mode approach and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks and implementing them on NI-MyRIO microcontroller.
