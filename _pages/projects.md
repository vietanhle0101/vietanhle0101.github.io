## Learning-based Model Predictive Control with Gaussian Processes

This project aims to enhance the performance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for single dynamical systems or multi-agent systems by using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to learn system dynamics.

## Adaptive Sampling for Mobile Robotic Sensor Networks

In collaboration with Dr. Linh Nguyen (Australia Federation University), we develop efficient adaptive sampling strategies for Mobile Robotic Sensor Networks for monitoring a spatial phenomenon by using Gaussian Process.
