## Adaptive Sampling for Mobile Robotic Sensor Networks

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Linh Nguyen from Australia Federation University. In this project, we develop efficient adaptive sampling strategies for resource-constrained Mobile Robotic Sensor Network for monitoring a spatial phenomenon based on Gaussian Process. The adaptive sampling problem can be formulated as minimizing the negative log determinant of a predicted covariance matrix, which is a non-convex and highly complex function. Moreover, the constraints on robot mobility such as nonholonomic dynamics and inter-robot collision avoidance are taken into consideration. A manuscript has been submitted to ACC 2021.

## Learning based Distributed Model Predictive Control for Multi-agent Systems

This project aims to develop distributed algorithms for Learning based Distributed Model Predictive Control for multi-agent control systems, where the agentsâ€™ dynamics are modeled by a machine learning model. Check out [our CCTA 2020 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9206390), which employ the Gaussian Process to learn system dynamics, and a distributed algorithm, called linGP-SCP-ADMM, to solve the non-convex GP-DMPC problem effectively.
