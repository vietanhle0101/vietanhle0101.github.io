## Adaptive Sampling for Mobile Robotic Sensor Networks

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Linh Nguyen from Australia Federation University. In this project, we develop efficient adaptive sampling strategies for resource-constrained Mobile Robotic Sensor Network for monitoring a spatial phenomenon based on Gaussian Process. The adaptive sampling problem can be formulated as minimizing the negative log determinant of a predicted covariance matrix, which is a non-convex and highly complex function. Moreover, the constraints on robot mobility such as nonholonomic dynamics and inter-robot collision avoidance are taken into consideration. Some optimization techniques like Proximal ADMM and Successive Convexification Programming can be applied to efficiently solve this problem in continuous domain.

## Gaussian Process based Distributed Model Predictive Control for Multi-agent Systems

This project aims to develop distributed algorithms for data-driven Distributed Model Predictive Control for multi-agent control systems, where the agentsâ€™ dynamics are modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). We employ the linearized Gaussian Process (linGP) concept, to sequentially approximate the stochastic latent processes of the GP models in a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) framework, leading to a convex linGP-DMPC subproblem, which is solved cooperatively by the agents with the ADMM algorithm. The resulting distributed algorithm, called linGP-SCP-ADMM, can solve non-convex GP-DMPC for multi-agent systems effectively since the data and computation are distributed among the agents.
