## Learning-based Model Predictive Control with Gaussian Processes

This project aims to enhance the performance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for single dynamical systems or multi-agent systems by using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to learn system dynamics.

# Past Projects

<!-- This temporary [poster](../files/MRSN_poster.pdf) may be helpful to get the overall idea. -->

## Modeling and Control of Overhead Cranes/Ship-mounted Cranes

This research and experiment were conducted when I was an undergraduate research intern at School of Mechanical Engineering, Vietnam Maritime University. My duty includes designing anti-swing control algorithms for uncertain overhead cranes/ship-mounted cranes using adaptive sliding mode control approach and implementing them on NI-MyRIO microcontroller.
