## Optimal Weight Adaptation for Model Predictive Control with Bayesian Optimization

<!-- In this project, we develop intelligent motion planning and control methods for connected and automated vehicles in different traffic scenarios with the presence of human-driven vehicles. The foundation of these control methods lies at the intersection of optimal or predictive control, optimization, machine learning, and game theory. -->

## Modeling and Control of Overhead Cranes/Ship-mounted Cranes

This research and experiment were conducted when I was an undergraduate research intern at School of Mechanical Engineering, Vietnam Maritime University. My duty includes designing anti-swing control algorithms for uncertain overhead cranes/ship-mounted cranes using adaptive sliding mode control approach and implementing them on NI-MyRIO microcontroller.
