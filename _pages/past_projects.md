## Modeling and Control of Overhead Cranes/Ship-mounted Cranes

This research and experiment were conducted when I was an undergraduate research intern at School of Mechanical Engineering, Vietnam Maritime University. My duty includes designing anti-swing control algorithms for uncertain overhead cranes/ship-mounted cranes using adaptive sliding mode control approach and implementing them on NI-MyRIO microcontroller.
