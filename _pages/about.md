I am a M.Sc. student at the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, Northern Arizona University. I received the B.Sc. degree in Automation and Control Engineering (Talented program) from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam in 2019. Starting from Fall 2021, I will pursue the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Delaware under the supervision of Dr. Andreas Malikopoulos.
<!-- at the [IDS Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/ids-lab/people/). -->
My current research interest includes Learning-based Control, Model Predictive Control, Distributed Optimization, Multi-agent and Autonomous Systems. I am a Student Member of the IEEE and the IEEE Control System Society.
